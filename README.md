# NtRaiseHardError-Example

I gave some examples on how to use ntdll's undocumented function "NtRaiseHardError"!
You can you use to cause a bsod or aso known as blue screen of death in Windows

# Compilers

If you are going to compile this with mingw you might have to link the ntdll, to make it work.
In Visual Studio you can just create a project and use it **DO NOT FORGET to add Administrator permissions**
Or it will not work.
